3. Average Prices per Neighborhood

4. Top 10 Most expenseive Neighborhoods

   Report the top ten most expensive neighborhoods

5. Parallel Coordinates and Parallel Categories Analysis

   Shows different interactive relationships between sale price, housing unit, gross rent, and neighborhoods. 

6. Neighborhood Map
